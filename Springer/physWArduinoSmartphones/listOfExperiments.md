# Experiments
The experiments proposed in the text are just examples used to introduce to the general
techniques. Many possible variations can be easily implemented. Some proposal can be
found on [smartphysicslab.org](https://www.smartphysicslab.org/), to which you are invited
to contribute.

# exp 1
Study of light absorption (Beer-Lambert Law)<br>
*smartphone* any source of light (e.g. a second smartphone, or a tabletop lamp),
	     any set of transparent sheets (e.g. cut from a plastic punched pocket
	     wallet for paper sheets)<br>
*Arduino* any analog light sensor or a series of a photoresistor and a resistor of
	  few kOhms. Connect the leads of the series to GND and 5V, then measure
	  the voltage across the photoresistor.
# exp 2
Free fall<br>
*smartphone* inflatable balloons, a needle, a holder for the balloon (e.g., we use
	     a sieve to which we removed the mesh)<br>
*Arduino* two light sources (LED's) and two light sensors (this version uses photogates)

# exp 3
Counting experiments<br>
*smartphone* you can use an App called Cosmic Ray Live: it shows real cosmic rays tracks
	     obtained with muon telescopes distributed worldwide.<br>
*Arduino* a buzzer or a small loudspeaker

# exp 4
Motion along an incline<br>
*Arduino* an ultrasonic sensor HCSR04, an inclined plane (a plank, a pastry board, a drawer,
	  a large hard-cover book, etc.), anything sliding along the plane (a toy car)<br>

# exp 5
Study of the elastic force<br>
*smartphone* rubber bands or springs, a holder (an ironing board, a clothesline),
	     a weight (a flask)<br>
*Arduino* the spring can be a slinky one, and the weight can be just a disk of cardboard.

Experiments 6 to 9 are not very suitable for Arduino, unless you record data on an SD card.
This is documented in the text, as well as the usage of the needed sensors, however, no
specific detail is given on the experiment. For the sensors, we suggest using the Grove
series, because they are easy to connect with the help of the Grove base shield. 

# exp 6
Non-inertial frames: free fall<br>
*smartphone* just a bed, in fact :-)<br>
*Arduino* an SD card module, an accelerometer (or an IMU: Inertial Measurement Unit)

# exp 7
Non-inertial frames: rotations<br>
*smartphone* something rotating: a rotating TV-support, the wheel of a bicycle, a salad spinner<br>
*Arduino* an SD	card module, a gyroscope (or an IMU: Inertial Measurement Unit)

# exp 8
Non-inertial frames: Euler acceleration <br>
*smartphone* a bucket, few meters of a thin rope<br>
*Arduino* an SD	card module, an	accelerometer and a gyroscope (or an IMU: Inertial Measurement Unit)

# exp 9
Rigid bodies and moment of inertia<br>
*smartphone* a cylinder: a poster tube, or the holder of a liquor bottle, an inclined plane (see above)<br>
*Arduino* an SD	card module, a gyroscope (or an IMU: Inertial Measurement Unit)

# exp 10
Wave mechanics: interference<br>
*smartphone* stereo loudspeakers or earphones<br>
*Arduino* a microphone

# exp 11
Sound speed as a function of the temperature<br>
*Arduino* a digital thermometer DS18B20 (waterproof version suggested, such that it will be
	  useful in calorimetry experiments, too).
